# What is this?
(THESE ARE NOT EXPLOITS THESE ARE DEVELOPMENT SCRIPTS!)
This is a place where you can get free scripts and use them in anyway, shape, or form.
Request to add scripts in the pull requests which can or doesn't have to include a script, it can just be a suggestion.
We reccomend checking out our game Arium Script Hub made by Arium Productions for more scripts along with paid scripts (Paid in Robux)
